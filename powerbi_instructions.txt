Power BI Import Instructions:
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Click 'Get Data' -> 'Text/CSV' and select the CSV file(s) from the exported folder.
   Recommended files to import:
   - section_level_data_for_powerbi.csv (detailed row-level scores - for slicers & drillthrough)
   - dashboard_agg_by_month.csv (monthly aggregates for trend visuals) [if available]
   - low_reviews_detail.csv (to inspect low-score cases)
   - top_negative_words.csv (to create word bars or tag cloud using Power BI visuals)
3. After importing, mark 'review_date_parsed' as Date type and 'year_month' as text or date (first day of month) as you prefer.
4. Create relationships if you import multiple files (use 'year_month' or review_date_parsed as join keys).

   - Line chart: monthly avg overall score (use dashboard_agg_by_month.csv)
   - Bar chart: average score by section (use section_level_data_for_powerbi aggregated)
   - Table: low_reviews_detail with filters for staff/room/date
   - Slicer: year_month
   - KPI cards: overall mean score, number of reviews, low review count
6. Use the 'Top Negative Words' to create a bar chart or use a custom word cloud visual.
